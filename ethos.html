                Makers make and what they make is MADE. <br />
                What if the tools for creation could be democratized? <br />
                What if artists didn't have to starve? <br />
                What if all people could create rather than labor? <br />
                MADE INFINITE is the ideological holding company for this
                vision. <br />
